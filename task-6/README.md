I didnt know "Go" when I started this task. I first learned the basic syntax. Then visited the github link provided and checked the documentation. There were 
examples of how to find a subreddit and upvote a post.

Wrote my script according to those examples but still got a few errors, but after learning the functions
in the provided examples I got the desired output.
