The first errors I faced were syntax error. Most of them were just missing semicolons.

Then there were logical errors. The text on the start and stop button were interchanged and the random numbers generated were wrong. I looked up the syntax of the random function and fixed it.

The add,subtract,multiply,divsion buttons were interchanged.
